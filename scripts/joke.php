"A man just moved to the country on a small farm. He went around to meet the neighbors and to his surprise, they started giving him welcoming gifts. The first neighbor gave him a rooster.
\"Thank you for the rooster!\", exclaimed the man.
\"You're quite welcome,\", the neighbor replied, \"but in these parts, we call those cocks\".
The next neighbor gave the man a hen.
\"Thanks for the hen!\", exclaimed the man.
\"You're quite welcome,\" the neighbor replied, \"but in these parts, we call that a pullet\".
His third neighbor was even more giving than the other two. He presented the man with a donkey.
\"Tthanks for the donkey!\" the man exclaimed.
\"You're very welcome,\" the neighbor replies, \"but in these parts, that's called an ass. There is one small thing about this ass in particular, and that is, sometimes he will stop and refuse to move. The only way you can get him moving again if this happens is to scratch him behind the ears\".
The man started the long journey home. He was about three quarters of the way there when suddenly, the donkey stopped walking. It refused to budge even one inch. The man was starting to despair of ever getting home, because his arms were full what with the hen and rooster and all. But just as the man started to give up hope, a beautiful woman walked down the road toward him.
Over joyed, the man called out to her, \"Howdy mam! Can you hold my cock and pullet while I scratch my ass?\"",

"The value of a #2 pencil in a Catholic education.
Little Susie was not the best student in Catholic School . Usually she slept through the class.
One day her teacher, a Nun, called on her while she was sleeping.
'Tell me Susie, who created the universe?'
When Susie didn't stir, little Johnny who was her friend sitting behind her, took his pencil and jabbed her in the rear.
'God Almighty!' shouted Susie.
The Nun said, 'Very good' and continued teaching her class..
A little later the Nun asked Susie, 'Who is our Lord and Savior?'
But Susie didn't stir from her slumber. Once again, Johnny came to her rescue and stuck her in the butt.
'Jesus Christ!!!' shouted Susie.
And the Nun once again said, 'Very good,' and Susie fell back asleep.
The Nun asked her a third question...'What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?'
Again, Johnny came to the rescue. This time Susie jumped up and shouted, 'If you stick that damn thing in me one more time, I'll break it in half!'

"THIS IS AN ACTUAL CUSTOMER REVIEW FROM A MAN ON A PUPULAR SHOPPING SITE AFTER USING VEET HAIR REMOVAL CREAM FOR MEN. After having been told my danglies looked like an elderly Rastafarian I decided to take the plunge and buy some of this as previous shaving attempts had only been mildly successful and I nearly put my back out trying to reach the more difficult bits. Being a bit of a romantic I thought I would do the deed on the missus's birthday as a bit if a treat. I ordered it well in advance and working in the North Sea I considered myself a bit above some of the characters writing the previous reviews and wrote them off as soft office types... Oh my fellow sufferers how wrong I was. I waited until the other half was tucked up in bed and after giving some vague hints about a special surprise I went down to the bathroom. Initially all went well and I applied the gel and stood waiting for something to happen. I didn't' have long to wait. At first there was a gentle warmth which in a matter of seconds was replaced by an intense burning and a feeling I can only describe as like being given a barbed wire wedgie by two people intent on hitting the ceiling with my head. Religion hadn't featured much in my life until that night but I suddenly became willing to convert to any religion to stop the violent burning around the turd tunnel and what seemed like the destruction of the meat and two veg.  Struggling not to bite through my bottom lip I tried to wash the gel off in the sink and only succeeded in blocking the plughole with a mat of hair.  Through the haze of tears I struggled out of the bathroom across the hall into the kitchen, by this time walking was not really possible and I crawled the final yard to the fridge in the hope of some form of cold relief. I yanked the freezer drawer out and found a tub of ice cream, took the lid off and positioned it under me. The relief was fantastic but only temporary as it melted fairly quickly and the fiery stabbing returned. Due to the shape of the ice cream tub I hadn't managed to give the starfish any treatment and I groped around in the draw for something else as I was sure my vision was going to fail fairly soon. I grabbed a bag of what I later found out was frozen sprouts and tore it open trying to be quiet as I did so. I took a handful of them and an tried in vain to clench some between the cheeks of my arse. This was not doing the trick as some of the gel had found its way up the chutney channel and it felt like the space shuttle was running its engines behind me. This was probably and hopefully the only time in my life I was going to wish there was a gay snowman in the kitchen which should give you some idea of the depths I was willing to sink to in order to ease the pain. The only solution my pain crazed mind could come up with was to gently ease one of the sprouts where no veg had gone before.  Unfortunately, alerted by the strange grunts coming from the kitchen the other half chose that moment to come and investigate and was greeted by the sight of me, arse in the air, strawberry ice cream dripping from my bell end pushing a sprout up my arse while muttering arhhh ooooohhh that feels good ahhh Understandably this was a shock to her and she let out a scream and as I hadn't heard her come in it caused an involuntary spasm of shock in myself which resulted in the sprout being ejected at quite some speed in her direction. I can understand that having a sprout fired against your leg at 11 at night in the kitchen probably wasn't the special surprise she was expecting and having to explain to the kids the next day what the strange hollow in the ice cream was didn't improve my status so to sum it up.....  VEET removes hair, dignity and self-respect found its way up the chutney channel and it felt like the space shuttle was running its engines behind me.

"An elderly couple is enjoying a 50 year anniversary dinner together in a small tavern. The husband leans over and asks his wife, \"Do you remember the first time we had sex together over fifty years a go? We went behind this tavern where you leaned against the fence and I made love to you.\"
\"Yes,\" she says, \"I remember it well.\"
\"Ok,\" he says, \"How about taking a stroll round there again and we can do it for old time's sake.\"
\"Oooooooh Charlie, you devil, that sounds like a good idea.\"
There's a police officer sitting in the next booth listening to all this, and having a chuckle to himself. He thinks, \"I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble.\" So he follows them. They walk haltingly along, leaning on each other for support, aided by walking sticks. Finally they
get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence. The old lady lifts her skirt, takes her knickers down and the old man drops his trousers. She turns around and as she hangs on to the fence, the old man moves in.
Suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the watching policeman has ever seen. They are bucking and jumping like eighteen-year-olds. This goes on for about forty minutes.
She's yelling, \"Ohhh, God!\" He's hanging on to her hips for dear life. This is the most athletic sex imaginable. Finally, they both collapse panting on the ground. The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life that he didn't know. After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The Policeman, still watching thinks, that was truly amazing, he was going like a train. I've got to ask him what his secret is.
As the couple passes, he says to them, \"That was something else. You must have been having sex for about forty minutes. How do you manage it? You must have had a fantastic life together. Is there some sort of secret?\"
The old man says, \"Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence.\"",

" A rabbi wanted to raise money for his synagogue and on being told there was a fortune in horse-racing, decided to purchase a horse and enter it in the races. However, at the local auction, the going price for a horse was so high that he ended up buying a donkey instead. He figured that since he had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races. To his surprise, the donkey came in third. The next day the local paper carried this headline: RABBI'S ASS SHOWS.
The rabbi was so pleased with the donkey that he entered it in the race again, and this time it won. The local paper read: RABBI'S ASS OUT FRONT.
The Shul president was so upset with this kind of publicity that he ordered the rabbi not to enter the donkey in another race. Then next day, the local paper headline read: SHUL PRESIDENT SCRATCHES RABBI'S ASS
This was too much for the Shul president, so he ordered the rabbi to get rid of the donkey. The rabbi decided to give it to the rebbetzin. The local paper, hearing of the news, posted the following headline the next day: REBBETZIN HAS BEST ASS IN TOWN.
The Shul president fainted. He informed the rebbetzin that she would have to get rid of the donkey, so she sold it to a farmer for ten dollars. The next day, the paper read: REBBETZIN SELLS ASS FOR $10.
This was too much for the Shul president, so he ordered the rebbetzin to buy back the donkey and lead it to the plains where it could run wild.
Headlines read: REBBETZIN ANNOUNCES HER ASS IS WILD AND FREE.
The Shul president was buried the next day",
