"Little April was not the best student in Sunday school.
Usually she slept through the class.
One day the teacher called on her while she was napping, \"Tell me, April, who created the universe?\"
When April didn't stir, little Johnny, a boy seated in the chair behind her, took a pin and jabbed her in the rear. 
\"GOD ALMIGHTY!\" shouted April and the teacher said, \"Very good\" and April fell back asleep.
A while later the teacher asked April, \"Who is our Lord and Saviour,\" But, April didn't even stir from her slumber.
Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again. 
\"JESUS CHRIST!\" shouted April and the teacher said, \"very good,\" and April fell back to sleep.
Then the teacher asked April a third question. 
\"What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?\" 
And again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin. 
This time April jumped up and shouted, \"IF YOU STICK THAT FuckinG THING IN ME ONE MORE TIME, I'LL BREAK IT IN HALF AND STICK IT UP YOUR AsS!\"
The Teacher fainted.",
"Little Johnny's teacher is warned at the beginning of the school year not to ever make a bet with Johnny unless she is absolutely sure she will win it.
One day in class, Johnny raises his hand and says \"teacher, I'll bet you $50 I can guess what color your underwear is.\"
She replies, \"okay, meet me after class and we'll settle it.\" But beforeclass ends, she goes to the restroom and removes her panties.
After class is over and the studentsclear out, Johnny makes his guess.
\"Blue.\"
\"Nope. You got it wrong,\" she says as she lifts her skirt to reveal she isn't wearing any underwear.
\"Well come with me out to my dads car, he's waiting for me, and I'll get you the money.\" She follows him out.
When they get to the car she informs his dad that he got the bet wrong and that she showed Johnny that she wasn't wearing any underwear.
His dad exclaims: \"That mother fucker! He bet me $100 this morning that he'd see your pussy before the end of the day!\"",
"Little Johnny was sitting in class doing math problems when his teacher picked him to answer a question, \"Johnny, if there were five birds sitting on a fence and you shot one with your gun, how many would be left?\"
\"None,\" replied Johnny, \"cause the rest would fly away.\"
\"Well, the answer is four,\" said the teacher, \"but I like the way you're thinking.\" 
Little Johnny says, \"I have a question for you. If there were three women eating ice cream cones in a shop, one was licking her cone, the second was biting her cone and the third was sucking her cone, which one is married?\" 
\"Well,\" said the teacher nervously, \"I guess the one sucking the cone.\" 
\"No,\" said Little Johnny, \"the one with the wedding ring on her finger, but I like the way you're thinking.\"",
"A new teacher was trying to make use of her psychology courses.
She started her class by saying, \"Everyone who thinks they're stupid, stand up!\"
After a few seconds, Little Johnny stood up. 
The teacher said, \"Do you think you're stupid, Little Johnny?\"
\"No, ma'am, but I hate to see you standing there all by yourself!\"",
"A teacher was working with a group of children, trying to broaden their horizons through sensory perception.
She brought in a variety of lifesavers and said, \"Children, I'd like you to close your eyes and taste these.\"
The kids easily identified the taste of cherries, lemons and mint, but when the teacher gave them honey-flavored lifesavers, all of the kids were stumped.
I'll give you a hint,\" said the teacher. 
\"It's something your mommy probably calls your daddy all the time.\"
Instantly, Little Johnny coughed his onto the floor and shouted, \"Quick! 
Spit'em out! 
They're assholes!\"",
"One day at the end of class, little Johnny's teacher asks the class to go home and think of a story to be concluded with the moral of that story. 
The following day the teacher asks for the first volunteer to tell their story.
Little Suzy raises her hand. 
\"My dad owns a farm and every Sunday we load the chicken eggs on the truck and drive into town to sell them at the market. 
Well, one Sunday we hit a big bump and all the eggs flew out of the basket and onto the road.\"
When the teacher asked for the moral of the story, Suzy replied, \"Don't keep all your eggs in one basket.\"
Little Lucy went next. 
\"My dad owns a farm too. 
Every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator. 
Last weekend only eight of the 12 eggs hatched.\";
Again, the teacher asked for the moral of the story.
Lucy replied, \"Don't count your chickens before they hatch.\"
Next up was little Johnny. 
\"My uncle Ted fought in the Vietnam war, and his plane was shot down over enemy territory. 
He jumped out before it crashed but could only take a case of beer, a machine gun and a machete. 
On the way down, he drank the case of beer. 
Then he landed right in the middle of 100 Vietnamese soldiers. 
He shot 70 with his machine gun, but then he ran out of bullets! 
So he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more. 
Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.\"
The teacher looked a little shocked. 
After clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story.
\"Well,\" Johnny replied, \"Don't fuck with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking.\"",
"One day, Little Johnny saw his grandpa smoking his cigarettes. Little Johnny asked, \"Grandpa, can I smoke some of your cigarettes?\" His grandpa replied, \"Can your penis reach your asshole?\" \"No\", said Little Johnny. His grandpa replied, \"Then you're not old enough.\"

The next day, Little Johnny saw his grandpa drinking beer. He asked, \"Grandpa, can I drink some of your beer?\" His grandpa replied, \"Can your penis reach your asshole?\" \"No\" said Little Johhny. \"Then you're not old enough.\" his grandpa replied.

The next day, Little Johnny was eating cookies. His grandpa asked, \"Can I have some of your cookies?\" Little Johnny replied, \"Can your penis reach your asshole?\" His grandpa replied, \"It most certainly can!\" Little Johnny replied, \"Then go fuck yourself.",
"A teacher asks her class, \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\"
Little Johnny says \"I wanna be a billionaire, going to the most expensive clubs, take the best bitch with me, give her a Ferrari worth over a million bucks, an apartment in Hawaii, a mansion in Paris, a jet to travel through Europe, an Infinite Visa Card and to make love to her three times a day\".
The teacher, shocked, and not knowing what to do with the bad behavior of the child, decides not to give importance to what he said and then continues the lesson.
\"And you, Susie? \" the teacher asks.
Susie says \"I wanna be Johnny's bitch.\"",
"Finding one of her students making faces at others on the playground, Ms. Smith stopped to gently reprimand the child.
Smiling sweetly, the Sunday school teacher said, \"Johnny, when I was a little girl, I was told if that I made ugly faces, it would freeze and I would stay like that.\" 
Little Johnny looked up and replied, \"Well, Ms Smith, you can't say you weren't warned.\"",
"Little Johnny comes home from sunday school with a black eye. 
His father sees it and says, \"Johnny, how many times do I have to tell you not to fight with the other boys?\"     \"But Dad, it wasn't my fault. 
We were all in church saying our prayers. We all stood up and my teacher in front of me had her dress in the crack of her butt. 
I reached over and pulled it out. 
That's when she hit me!\"     
\"Johnny,\" the father said. 
\"You don't do those kind of things to women.\"     
Sure enough, the very next sunday Johnny came home with the other eye black and blue. 
Johnny's father said, \"Johnny, I thought we had a talk!\"     
\"But Dad,\" Johnny said, \"It wasn't my fault. 
There we were in church saying our prayers. 
We all stood up and my teacher in front of us had her dress in the crack of her butt. 
Then Louie who was sitting next to me saw it and he reached over and pulled it out. 
Now I know she doesn't like this, so I pushed it back in!\""
